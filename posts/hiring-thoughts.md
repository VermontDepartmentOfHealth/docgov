## Hello & Welcome

## Strengths Based Questions





## Keep Requirements Simple

Groups that tend to be overconfident may apply even if they only meet some, but not all, of the criteria.  However, some applicants may feel intimidated and choose not to apply even if they satisfy a good number of criteria.  Since we're not hiring for confidence, keep requirements minimal, and evaluate candidates based on their unique strengths.  

## Give Everyone the Inside Scoop

Your friends are statistically likely to look and act like you - your coworkers shouldn't be.  If you'd recommend a friend for the job and give them a heads up on what the overall structure looks like, how many people they might meet with, examples of types of questions that might get asked, then that information should be shared as widely as possible for all candidates.
