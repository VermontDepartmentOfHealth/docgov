#### Structured Data

Use [FAQ Structured Data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/faqpage)


```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": " What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported ‚Äì ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Not everyone infected with the COVID-19 virus has symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Triage & Training

* **Triage** (labor hours)
  * **Training Opportunity** - Query should have matched to better Answer
  * **Missing FAQ** - Answer doesn't yet exist in knowledge base
* **Training**
  * **Alternative Phrases** - question level
  * **Alterations** - word level

---

### Application Insights

```kql
traces
| where message contains "GenerateAnswer"
| extend input = tostring(customDimensions.Question),
        answer = tostring(customDimensions.Answer),
        scoreInt = toint(round(todouble(customDimensions.Score))),
        convoId = substring(itemId, 0, 7)
```

<!-- projection operations / predicate operations -->

## Lessons Learned

---

### Lesson #1

> Plan a lot of time for training

<!--
our accuracy rates were really bad
look at google docs her
-->

---

### Lesson #2

> Get content authors involved early

<!-- Bot answers are a different breed of answer -->

---

## Tips & Tricks

---

### Tip #1

**Problem**: Multi-authoring editing is still difficult

**Solution**: Use MS Teams / IM to manage authoring

---


### Tip #2

**Problem**: Question order isn't deterministic

**Solution**: Repeat question wording in answer

<!-- we actually treat the question in the answer body  as our canonical wording  -->
<!-- also helps when cognitive services matches on opposite -->

---


### Tip #3

**Problem**: IDs are lossy during publish

**Solution**: Use API and *lots* of logic

<!-- publish really just does a replace -->

---


## Demo

1. Create Knowledge Base - [https://www.qnamaker.ai/](https://www.qnamaker.ai/)
2. Add chitchat + question
3. Test / Train
4. Publish
5. Create Bot
6. Embed Bot

<!-- make sure to verify create  -->
