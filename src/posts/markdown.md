summary: "Markdown is a simple way to format text that is both human readable and can also be easily converted to a webpage"
---

It's no surprise... Markdown is my favorite ever! It translates really well into how I \*want\* to write out of the box.

It powers Stack Overflow, Github, and a good chunk of the internet, while offering a delicate balance between robust expressiveness in typography, human readability on all platforms, and amazingly simple full text search.

If you're just getting started there are a couple symbols to remember that will help translate text into **TEXT**!  There are plenty of online guides already detailing various flavors, but here's a brief overview contextualized into this site, including which elements are available and how they are displayed.

For some external quick reference guides, you can check out [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/) or the original [Markdown Syntax documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) by John Gruber
