I like .NET Development, JavaScript, and Cats

I'm an active contributor on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1366033/kylemit) with (60k+ rep).  I've given talks on Static Site Generation, User Experience & Design, ASP.NET, Twitter Bootstrap, WPF, WCF, MVVM, Meteor.js, Unit Testing and Windows 8 software development at the Vermont Code Camp (4x), Boston Code Camp (4x), Vermont Coders Connection, BTV JS, and VDH IT staff meetings.

I also try to blog at [CodingEverything.com](http://www.codingeverything.com/), but we'll see - I've made that promise before...
